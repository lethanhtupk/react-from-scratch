# react-from-scratch

This is a boilerplate Reactjs project I made to learn how to config a new reactjs project from scratch with flowing tools

- **Webpack** for module bundler included
  1. _webpack_: main package 
  2. _webpack-cli_: allow to interact with webpack through command line
  3. _webpack-dev-server_: provide hot-reload for development 
- **Babel** for transpile the special syntaxt (ig: JSX) to normal syntax that browser would understand (ES5)
- **ESlint** for force coding style 
- **Prettier** fpr auto styligng code based on rules that are defined at eslint.
