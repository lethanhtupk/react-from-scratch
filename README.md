# react-from-scratch

## What is this repository

This is a boilerplate Reactjs project I made to learn how to config a new reactjs project from scratch with flowing tools

1. **Webpack** for module bundler included
2. **Babel** for transpile the special syntaxt (ig: JSX) to normal syntax that browser would understand (ES5)
3. **ESlint** for force coding style 
4. **Prettier** fpr auto styligng code based on rules that are defined at eslint. 

## How to use it 

Just like with normal reactjs project. Make sure you already have nodejs installed. Clone project and do the following step 

1. Install neccessary dependencies by 

```terminal
yarn install
```

2. Run project by 

```terminal
yarn start
```
